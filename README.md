# Prompt Example

A simple exercise with React in which I have implemented creating a Prompt when the user wants to leave the page.

The project consists of 3 components: Home, Important and Alert. On the Home page, you have a heading and link to the Important page, where you have textarea with some default text. When the user enters some text besides default and clicks the browser's back button the Prompt is called and the Alert component is displayed.

## Dependencies:

- react-router-dom v5
- material-ui
